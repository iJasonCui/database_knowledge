### On the slave server(s):

1. Run "stop slave" to stop replication.

2. Run "reset slave" to tell the slave server to forget it's position in the binary log retrieved from the master server.

3. Add "skip-slave-start" to my.cnf to prevent replication from starting when you restart MySQL.

4. There's no need to restart MySQL on either the master or the slave. Complete documentation can be found 
in section 19 of the MySQL Reference Manual.

I'd recommend leaving the rest of the replication settings in place in case you decide to revert to your previous 
configuration. That way you'd just have to push the data over and reset the slave position 
(don't forget to remove skip-slave-start) rather than recreating the setup whole-cloth.
