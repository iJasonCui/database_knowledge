I left a message for you to call me. 

Basically, if you start with -iqdroplks it will mark all the pages as in use (and show that you are 100% full).  This is normal. 
If you start with -iqdroplks you must then immediately run sp_iqcheckdb to see if there are any problems.  If no problems are found the space is recovered and the allocation maps updated. If there is a problem (corruption) you will get a message letting you know which object has the problem.

Please call me and let me know if you need more details on how to run sp_iqcheckdb with -iqdroplks.
