Here is the general instructions on how to delete a large transaction from a WS queue if you cannot get 
enough sqt_max_cache_size to replicate it. I recommend this only be done with a Sybase Technical Support Engineer 
on the phone with you to make sure you do not make any mistakes while following this procedure. 

In your Replication Server for the warmstandby that is hung up run: 

admin who,sqm 
go 

admin who,sqt 
go 

In the admin who,sqt output, look for the inbound queue of the active connection for your stuck warmstandby and 
examine the First Trans values. It should look like: 

ST:O Cmds:124513 qid:145:15:5 

This indicates an open transaction that has received  124513 commands so far that has it's begin trans statement 
located at 145:15:5 of the stable queue. 

execute 
sysadmin hibernate_on 
go 
sysadmin sqm_zap_command,your_queue_number,the_queue_type,145,15,5   <--- from the first trans values 
go 
sysadmin hibernate_off 
go 

This procedure will not work unless all of the values are correct, so again, you should have Sybase Tech Support on the phone 
to help you through this procedure.

THANKS !!!
