My suggestion is that we try getting the server up as soon as possible by doing a 
"forced recovery" (see instructions below).

===========================================
To start a server in forced recovery mode:
===========================================
Jason:


1. Start the server with forced recovery (to mark all pages as used),
using the -iqfrec server startup option in the start_asiq command. For example:

start_asiq -n my_server -x 'tcpip(port=7934)' -gd dba -iqfrec my_db /database/my_db.db

You specify the database name twice, once to specify the database undergoing forced recovery and once to specify the database to start. The -iqfrec server startup 
option requires the database name. Note that this is the physical database name, which is case sensitive. Do not use select_dbname to determine the database name, 
as it returns the logical name assigned by the -n startup option.

Sybase strongly recommends that you start the IQ server with the -gd option set, to restrict server access to the DBA. Forced recovery operates in all modes, but 
restricted access gives the DBA greater control over inadvertent opens of the database.

2. Stop the server after it has started successfully. To stop the server, use stop_asiq on UNIX or the shutdown button in the console window on Windows.
3. Start the server with the drop leaks option -iqdroplks. See the section "Leaked space recovery" for more details.

start_asiq -n my_server -x "tcpip(port=2638)" -gd dba -iqdroplks my_db /database/my_db.db

4. Run sp_iqcheckdb in allocation mode to free up unallocated pages.

sp_iqcheckdb 'allocation database';

5. Stop the server after sp_iqcheckdb finishes.
6. Restart the server using your usual method, without the -iqfrec and -iqdroplks options.


Hope this helps!
