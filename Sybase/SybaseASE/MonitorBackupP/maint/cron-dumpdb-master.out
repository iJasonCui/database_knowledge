WARNING: In order to LOAD the master database, the SQL Server must run in
single-user mode.  If the master database dump uses multiple volumes, you must
execute sp_volchanged on another SQL Server at LOAD time in order to signal
volume changes.
Backup Server session id is:  0.  Use this value when executing the
'sp_volchanged' system stored procedure after fulfilling any volume change
request from the Backup Server.
