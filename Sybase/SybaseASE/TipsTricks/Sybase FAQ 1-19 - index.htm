                        What's happening with the FAQ?                         
                                                                               
I have not had a lot of time to spend on the FAQ this year. Mainly, this is
down to work, or the lack of it. I know, we are all in the same boat. Well, it
has meant that I have had a lot less free time than I used to and as a result
the FAQ has not been kept as up to date as I would like. Sadly, the work I have
been doing is with those other database vendors, but we won't name them here.
Anyway, that is the sob story over and done with. If anyone thinks that they
would like to see more effort applied, I would be happy to hand the mantle
over. Since the amount of help that I have actually seen amounts to about
practically none, then I am sure I will not be over-run with offers! I will
definitely have more time come January and plan some serious work on it then.

                         How can I help with the FAQ?                          
                                                                               
I have had offers from a couple of people to write sections, but if you feel
that you are in a position to add support for a section, or if you have some
FAQs to add, please let me know.  This is a resource that we should all
support, so send me the stuff and I will include it.

Typos and specific corrections are always very useful. Less useful is the
general I don't think that section x.y.z is very understandable. Sorry to sound
harsh, but what I need is actual text that is more readable. Better still is
actual HTML that makes it stand out and sing (if necessary)!

Currently I am looking for maintainers of the following sections Replication,
Adaptive Server Anywhere, IQ server, MPP Server and Open Server.  I am not sure
whether to add a section for Omni Server.  I sort of feel that since Omni has
been subsumed into ASE as CIS that any FAQs should really be incorporated
there.   However, if you know of some good Omni gotchas or tips, whether they
are still there in CIS or not, please send them in.  I certainly plan to have a
subsection of ASE dealing with CIS even if Omni does not get its own major
section.  I also think that we need sections on some of the really new stuff. 
Jaguar and the new engines also deserve a spot.

Another very useful way that you can help is in getting people to update their
links.  I have seen lots of links recently, some still pointing to Pablo's
original, some pointing to Tom's site but referring to it as coming from the
SGI site.

                   Who do I tell about problems in the FAQ?                    
                                                                               
The current maintainer is David Owen ( dowen@midsomer.org) and you can send
errors in the FAQ directly to me.  If you have an FAQ item (both the question
and the answer) send it to <A HREF="mailto:sybfaq@midsomer.org">sybfaq@midsomer.org</A> and I will include it.

Do not send email to any of the officials at ISUG, they are simply hosting the
FAQ and are not responsible for its contents.

Also, do not send email to Sybase, they are not responsible for the contents
either.  See the Disclaimer.

Special thanks must go to the following people for their help in getting this
FAQ to where it is today.

  * Pablo Sanchez for getting the FAQ off the ground in the first place and for
    many years of dedicated work in maintaining it.
   
  * Anthony Mandic (<A HREF="mailto:am@peppler.org">am@peppler.org</A>) for a million things.  Patiently answering
    questions in all of the Sybase news groups, without which most beginners
    would be lost.  For supporting and encouraging me in getting this FAQ
    together and for providing some pretty neat graphics.
   
  * The ISUG, especially Luc Van der Veurst (<A HREF="mailto:lucv@az.vub.ac.be">lucv@az.vub.ac.be</A>) and Michael
    Peppler (<A HREF="mailto:mpeppler@peppler.org">mpeppler@peppler.org</A>), for hosting this FAQ and providing support
    in setting up the website.
   
  * The members of the various news groups and mailing lists who, like Anthony,
    provide unstinting support.  The list is fairly long, but I think that Bret
    Halford (<A HREF="mailto:bret@sybase.com">bret@sybase.com</A>) deserves a mention.   If you go to Google News
    and do a search, he submits almost as many replies as Anthony.

                                 Hall of Fame                                  
                                                                               
I am not sure how Pablo chose his select list, there is certainly no question
as to their inclusion.  I know that there are a couple of awards that the ISUG
give out each year for the people that the ISUG members believe have
contributed most to the Sybase community that year.  I think that this section
should honour those people that deserve an award each and every year.  If you
know of a candidate, let me know and I will consider his or her inclusion. 
Self nominations are not acceptable :-)

The following people have made it to the Sybase FAQ Hall of Fame:

  * Michael Peppler (mpeppler@peppler.org)   For Sybperl and all of the other
    tools of which he is author or instigator plus the ceaseless support that
    he provides through countless mailing lists, newsgroups and directly via
    email.
   
  * Scott Gray (<A HREF="mailto:gray@voicenet.com">gray@voicenet.com</A>)   Father of sqsh, much more than simply a
    replacement for isql.  How anyone developing or administering Sybase can
    survive without it, I will never know.
   
  * Pablo Sanchez ( www.hpdbe.com)  Pablo got the first web based FAQ off the
    ground, wrote most (all?) of the first edition and then maintained it for a
    number of years.   He did a fantastic job, building a resource that is
    worth its weight in gold.
