1,install ASE 15 in different directory
  generate license key and copy to $SYBASE/SYSAM-2_0/licenses/servername.lic

2, check and adjust servers to be upgraded
 
(1) set OLDSYBASE, OLDSYBASE_ASE,OLDSYBASE_OCS environment variables to point to the old installation of ASE
Run preupgrade to check and report upgrade problems such as reserved words conflict and space issue.
 
$SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/upgrade/preupgrade -Usa -Swebdb0g -I$OLDSYBASE/interfaces. .

(2)according to output of preupgrade,  change parameters to make them eligible for new version

NOTE: if the following parameters are greater than the following respective values, DO NOT reconfigure them.

sp_configure 'procedure cache size',12000   *
sp_configure 'default database size',3           *
sp_configure 'number of aux scan descriptors',256 *
sp_configure 'number of locks',10000                     *
sp_configure 'max network packet size',2048
sp_configure 'default network packet size',2048
sp_configure 'dtm detach timeout period',300

(3) extend database to accommodate more info needed by new version
make sure the size of the following db is greater than respective values, if they are already greater, DO NOT extend them any more
eg: alter database model on master = '2M'
tempdb  3+1M
model 2+2M
sybsystemdb 3+1M
sybsystemprocs 132+55
and userdb as well

For new device,
disk init
name=tempdb_device?
physname=/data/db/tempdb_device.dat
size='100M'
dsync=false

For existing device,
disk resize 
name=device1
size='100M'

Alter database tempdb on tempdb_device = '100m'

(4) change all config and run pregrade again until no error occured


3, If the users of old and new installation of ASE are different, please grant read and write privileges of  all related files in old installation to new user.
NOTE: make sure all device files are accessible by new user

Chmod  -R g+rw * (suppose they have the same group)

4, upgrade Adaptive Server
 
(1) copy upgrade resource file at $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/init/sample_resource_files/sqlupgrade.adaptive_server.rs and edit the file

(2) make sure environment variables are correct, otherwise we need to run '. SYBASE.sh'

(3) comment out cron job on opsdb2p which gets sysmon report every 5 minutes.

(4) suspend all connection to the server to be upgraded.

(5) run the following command
  $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/bin/sqlupgraderes -r upgrade.ase15.rs
  
  It usually takes over 25 minutes , depends on different   configuration and databases of servers.And the new server will start up automatically.
  Check the output to make sure everything is OK.

(6) resume connections

(7) uncomment cron job on opsdb2p

5, Upgrade backup Server
(1) edit resource file and run sqlupgrade
(2) shutdown and restart backup server

6, check environment variable, RUN file, interface file,   log file and permissions,make some changes if necessary (eg: log file).

7, replicated database can't be online automatically ,    dbcc dbrepair(CCEncrypted, ltmignore),then online    database manually.
