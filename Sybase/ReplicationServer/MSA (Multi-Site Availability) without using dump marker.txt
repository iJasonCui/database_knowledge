MSA (Multi-Site Availability) without using dump marker
===============================================================

step 1:

[NAMING CONVENTION]

1: [table rep def] prad_a_profile_dating which is {DB short name}_{full table name}. "prad" means "LPortal".
2: [db rep def]    LPortal  which is {full_db_name}
3: [db sub]        w151dbr06_LPortal which is {full_server_name}_{full_db_name}
4: [table sub]     03prad_a_profile_dating  {short_server_name}{DB short name}_{full table name}


#-------------------------------------#
# The dump db solution 
#-------------------------------------#

step 1:  [rep server] create database replication definition 

[v151rep01]://{1}# create database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal

###### handy script #############
select "create database replication definition " + name  + " with primary at LogicalSRV." + name
from sysdatabases where dbid >= 4 and dbid < 1000
################################

step 2: modify interfaces files accordingly

step 3: [rep server] rs_init to add db connection (regular)

--3.1 login [v151rep01] host as the 'repserver' user and add MSA database connection 

--3.2 edit the resource file "/ccs/repsrv15_0/REP-15_0/init/logs/w151dbr06_LPortal.msa.rs"

--3.2 run rs_init with resource file as follows:

[repserver@v151rep01:/ccs/repsrv15_0/REP-15_0/init/logs]$ 
/ccs/repsrv15_0/REP-15_0/install/rs_init -r /ccs/repsrv15_0/REP-15_0/init/logs/w151dbr06_LPortal.MSA.rs 

step 4: [rep server] define subscription

/* without using dump marker */

[v151rep01]: 
define subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 
check  subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 

#####/* using dump marker */
#####[v151rep01]://{1}# define subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal use dump marker
##### drop subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal without purge
##### same sa password for primary db server, primary rep server and replicate rep server
#####/* the end           */

step 5:  /*  suspend log transfer from primary db*/

suspend log transfer from c104dbp01.LPortal

step 6: wait for 2 minutes until stable queue is quiesce

step 7:  [rep server]

[v151rep01] activate and validate the subscription

activate subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 
check  subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 
validate subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 
check  subscription w151dbr06_LPortal for database replication definition LPortal with primary at LogicalSRV.LPortal with replicate at w151dbr06.LPortal 


step 8:  dump database on WARM STANDBY db server

[v151dbp02csc] isql -Ucron_sa -Sv151dbp02csc

dump database LPortal

step 10: scp to MSA db server and load it

--step 10.1: scp
[sybase@v151dbp02:/data/dump/v151dbp02csc/LPortal]$ scp -p LPortal-d* sybase@w151dbr06:/data/dump/LPortal

--step 10.2: suspend connection to msa db
[v151rep01] suspend connection to w151dbr06.LPortal

--step 10.3:  load database

[sybase@w151dbr06:/data/dump/LPortal]$ isql -Usa -Sw151dbr06 -i  load-db-LPortal.sql 

step 11: VERIFY maint_user as alias of dbo ON MSA DB SERVER

[w151dbr06]

--USE LPortal
--go
--EXEC sp_addalias 'v151rep01_maint_user','dbo'
--go


step 12: [rep server] resume connections

[v151rep01]
resume connection to w151dbr06.LPortal
resume log transfer from c104dbp01.LPortal

STEP 13: [MSA DB SERVER] VERIFY the ltm marker has been removed 

[w151dbr06] 

use LPortal
dbcc gettrunc
