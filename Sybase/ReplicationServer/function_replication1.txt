1, create proc to be replicated and wrap proc.

 Profile_ad/tsp_clean_ViewedMe (replicated proc) 
 Profile_ad/tsp_wrap_delViewedMe(wrap proc)

 Once a proc is marked as replicated, ASE treats is as ONE TRANSACTION!! Even you explicitly commit row by row.
 So if we do massive delete/update/insert, we need to create a replicated proc(against all related servers)which transaction size is small(like 1,000, 10,000) and a wrap proc (only on primary). 

2, enable replication for stored procedure at primary db server, use function instead of table 

   sp_setrepproc tsp_clean_ViewedMe, 'function'

3, create function repdef on primary repserver.

1> create function replication definition tsp_clean_ViewedMe with primary at LogicalSRV_web.Profile_ad (@batchSize smallint,@begindate  datetime,@cutoffdate datetime) 
2> go
Function replication definition 'tsp_clean_ViewedMe' is created.

4, create function subscription for replicated server(s) on replicate repserver

1> define subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe for tsp_clean_ViewedMe with replicate at w151tstdb02.Profile_ad
2> go
Subscription 'tsp_clean_ViewedMe' is in the process of being defined.
1> activate subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe for tsp_clean_ViewedMe with replicate at w151tstdb02.Profile_ad
2> go
Subscription 'tsp_clean_ViewedMe' is in the process of being activated.
1> validate subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe for tsp_clean_ViewedMe with replicate at w151tstdb02.Profile_ad
2> go
Subscription 'tsp_clean_ViewedMe' is in the process of being validated.
1> check subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe for tsp_clean_ViewedMe with replicate at w151tstdb02.Profile_ad
2> go
Subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe is VALID at the replicate.
Subscription tsp_clean_ViewedMe is VALID at the primary.
