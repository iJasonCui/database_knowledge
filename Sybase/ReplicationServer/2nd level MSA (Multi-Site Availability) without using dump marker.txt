step 1:

[NAMING CONVENTION]

1: [table rep def] prad_a_profile_dating which is {DB short name}_{full table name}. "prad" means "Profile_ad".
2: [db rep def]    Profile_ad  which is {full_db_name}
3: [db sub]        w151dbp03_Profile_ad which is {full_server_name}_{full_db_name}
4: [table sub]     03prad_a_profile_dating  {short_server_name}{DB short name}_{full table name}

step 1: add logical connection
[w151rep01]: create logical connection to LogicalSRV.Profile_ai

step 2: add primary db connection 
[repserver@w151rep01:~/REP-12_6/install]$ /opt/etc/repserver126/REP-12_6/install/rs_init -r /opt/etc/repserver126/REP-12_6/init/logs/resource.Profile_ai.BRP.p

step 3: create db rep def
[w151rep01]://{1}# create database replication definition Profile_ai with primary at w151dbp03.Profile_ai (wrong one)

[####### wrong one, if you have logical connection, you have to use Logical server name ##########]
[rep2p]://{2}# go
Msg 15248, Level 12, State 0
Server 'rep2d'
Cannot use active or standby connection names when creating or altering replication definitions or function replication definitions.
Must use logical connection name.
[rep_server]://{1}# create database replication definition Profile_ad with primary at LogicalSRV.Profile_ad

[w151rep01]://{1}# create database replication definition Profile_ai with primary at LogicalSRV.Profile_ai (good one)

Database replication definition 'Profile_ad' for webdb4p.Profile_ad is created.

step 4: add msa db connection
             
rs_init to add db connection (regular)

[repserver@w151rep01:~/REP-12_6/install]$ /opt/etc/repserver126/REP-12_6/install/rs_init -r /opt/etc/repserver126/REP-12_6/init/logs/resource.Profile_ai.BRP.rep.dbr01

USE Profile_ai
go
IF USER_ID('rep5p_maint_user') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    EXEC sp_dropuser 'rep5p_maint_user'
    IF USER_ID('rep5p_maint_user') IS NOT NULL
        PRINT '<<< FAILED DROPPING USER rep5p_maint_user >>>'
    ELSE
        PRINT '<<< DROPPED USER rep5p_maint_user >>>'
END
go

EXEC sp_addalias 'rep5p_maint_user','dbo'

step 6:

/* using dump marker */
[w151rep01]://{1}# define subscription w151dbp03_Profile_ad for database replication definition Profile_ad with primary at webdb4p.Profile_ad with replicate at w151dbp03.Profile_ad_view use dump marker
##### drop subscription w151dbp03_Profile_ad for database replication definition Profile_ad with primary at webdb4p.Profile_ad with replicate at w151dbp03.Profile_ad_view without purge
##### same sa password for primary db server, primary rep server and replicate rep server
/* the end           */

/* without using dump marker */
[w151rep01]:
define subscription w151dbr01_Profile_ai for database replication definition Profile_ai with primary at LogicalSRV.Profile_ai with replicate at w151dbr01.Profile_ai

######## dsi has been suspended on  w151dbp03.Profile_ad_view (VIP)

step 7:

dump db on webdb21p (comment out the tab)

step 8:

scp into BRP and load db w151dbr01.Profile_ai  without online

step 9: insert one row into reptest

step 10: suspend log transfer from webdb29p.Profile_ai

step 11: suspend connection to webdb21p.Profile_ai and dbo use only on webdb21p.Profile_ai

step 12: suspend route to rep5p

setp 13: resume log transfer from webdb29p.Profile_ai 

step 14: dump copy load the last tran from ws and then online database on msa db and then fix the main_user

[vip] check crontab on webdb21p (replicate db server)

step 15: resume connection to webdb21p.Profile_ai and turn of "dbo use only"

step 16: [w151rep01] sysadmin hibernate_on 

step 17: admin who to figure out the queue Id

step 18: [w151rep01] --sysadmin sqm_purge_queue, ***, 0

step 19: [w151rep01] admin disk_space to check the queue shrinked and then sysadmin hibernate_off

step 20: resume connection to w151dbr01.Profile_ai (it has been brought up)

step 21: resume route to rep5p AND TEST IT
