Catalog Store
The portion of each IQ database that contains its metadata. The default
name for this file is dbname.db.

IQ database
Databases that you create using Adaptive Server IQ databases are called IQ
databases for short. IQ databases are specially indexed to take advantage of
the query speed of Adaptive Server IQ. The default name for this dbspace is
dbname.iq.
Each IQ database that you create includes at least four dbspaces: an IQ Store
(for data), a Catalog Store (for metadata), a Temporary Store (for temporary
data) and an IQ message log.

IQ message log
A message log file created when the first user connects to an IQ database. The
default name for this file is dbname.iqmsg. Adaptive Server IQ logs error
messages, status messages and insert notification messages in this file.

IQ Transaction Log
The part of an IQ database that records changes to the database for use in
recovery from a system failure. It includes information about versions and free
space. The Transaction Log is created in the same directory as the Catalog
Store. The default name for this file is dbname.log.
